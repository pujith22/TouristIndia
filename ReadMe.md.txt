Intro:
   This is first iteration of our Android Application extending our "travel-web-site-scrapper" project. This application
provided the user with top places to be visited for the city he is being visited in the backend python scrappes and
compiles the data for you in real time.

Features:

1. Splash Screen
2. Easy and interactive interface.
3. Authetication to mobile number.

Upcoming Features:
1. Login with Google facility.
2. One of the drawback is we are using Chocopy for handling python procedure calls.
   And it is licensed product, Hence take around 5-10 for showing results.
   (To be upgraded to cloud function or other alternative for faster response).
3. User personalization and Paragraphs about the places to be displayed.

I will try best to upgrade the features as early as possible.
